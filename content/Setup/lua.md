# Lua

Visit the [Core](https://github.com/corp-por/core) and [Stones](https://github.com/corp-por/stones) repos, download and extract the repos into the *core* and *stones* folder created earlier.

# Clone

A better option is to have `git` installed and within the intended *current working directory* run:

    git clone https://github.com/corp-por/core
    git clone https://github.com/corp-por/stones

## Contributing

An even better option would be to Fork both core and stones, then clone your forks with the previous git clone commands. This allows you to make changes and commit back to your own Fork. Then you can submit a pull request to corp-por and get your commit into the repos we all use!
