# Map

The map in stones/mapdata/Boomtown will need to be loaded in [World Creator](/worldcreator) and exported before ServX will run with the default configuration.

Open CODEX and go to the World Creator. This will open with a new world. Go to File -> Open. Navigate to *stones\mapdata\Boomtown* and select this folder. Do not navigate down into *raw*. Once the Boomtown map has been loaded, go to File -> Export and wait for the export to finish. You should now see a *bin* folder under *stones\mapdata\Boomtown*.
